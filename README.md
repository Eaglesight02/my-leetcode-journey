# my-leetcode-journey
This repository is a collection of the 'Problem of the Day'(POTD) solutions that I've written, or inspired from one of the solutions.

### I already have a 100 day streak in the year of 2024. The reason I'm starting now is that I got this idea just a few days ago and what other day to start after achieving a milestone!!
### The progress of those 100 days is written as a post in Leetcode, you can view it [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/4658085/To-get-the-Leetcode-Laptop-sleeve.)

#### I also intend to keep updating the post everyday so keep checking it out!!
